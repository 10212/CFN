-  `NLSR - Named-data Link-State Routing
   protocol <https://github.com/named-data/NLSR>`__
-  `repo-ng - Next generation of NDN
   repository <https://github.com/named-data/repo-ng>`__
-  `ChronoChat - Multi-user NDN chat
   application <https://github.com/named-data/ChronoChat>`__
-  `ChronoSync - Sync library for multiuser realtime applications for
   NDN <https://github.com/named-data/ChronoSync>`__
-  `ndn-tlv-ping - Ping Application For
   NDN <https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tlv-ping>`__
-  `ndn-traffic - Traffic Generator For
   NDN <https://github.com/named-data/ndn-traffic>`__
