ndn-cpp:  A Named Data Networking client library for C++ and C
-------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

libcrypto

Build
-----

To build in a terminal, change directory to the ndn-cpp root.  Enter:

./configure
make

(There is currently no "install" step.)

Files
-----

This makes the following libraries:

.libs/libndn-c.a: The core C code for encoding and communication.
.libs/libndn-cpp.a: The C++ library API.  libndn-cpp also needs libndn-c.

This makes the following test files:

bin/test-get-async: Connect to one of the NDN testbed hubs, express an interest and display the received data.
bin/test-encode-decode-interest: Encode and decode an interest, testing interest selectors and the name URI.
bin/test-encode-decode-data: Encode and decode a data packet, including signing the data packet.

Supported platforms
-------------------

ndn-cpp is tested on the following platforms:
Ubuntu 12.04 (gcc 4.6.3)
Mac OS X 10.8.4 (clang 4.2)
Mac OS X 10.8.4 (gcc 4.2)
